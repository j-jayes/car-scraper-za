# Car Scraper ZA

## Purpose

I have a [shiny app](https://jonathan-jayes.shinyapps.io/gumtree-price-explorer/) that aims to inform second hand car buyers about the price various sellers are asking. It seperates cars by make, model, milage and age. It is based on data scraped from gumtree.

I want to improve this shiny app to include adverts from other websites.

I also want to use the [Pins package](https://pins.rstudio.com/) to keep more data available for the app to use. Currently it only shows ads scraped in the past day.

## Process

Currently I am working on creating some web scraping scripts for the different websites and then automating them with github actions.
